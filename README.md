# React Maps Examples

Some examples of displaying maps with JavaScript.

## Usage

1) install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2) start local dev server

```
npm start
```

3) formatting and linting

Formatting and linting is done with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

To fix all lint & formatting issues run:
```
npm run format
```


## Motivation
A lot of my friends have been trash talking "maps in the browser" saying that it can only be done well on a native app. This web app is meant to demo different JavaScript mapping libraries and really put them to the test to se how shitty (or not) they really are. ;)


## Libraries Displayed 

- Google maps 

- Leaflet - https://leafletjs.com/


## Contributing

Feel free to add examples with other maps libraries that have not yet been implemented here, and fee free to open pull requests with the examples!


## Scaffolding

This project was scaffolded with the [gatsby-starter-redux](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/caki0915/gatsby-starter-redux/) template:

```
npx gatsby new my-redux-starter https://github.com/caki0915/gatsby-starter-redux
```

Some included config files:


-  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

-  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

-  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

-  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

-  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
